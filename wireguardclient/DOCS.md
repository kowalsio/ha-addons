# WireGuard Client
## _Home Assistant Add-on_
[WireGuardÂ®](https://www.wireguard.com/) is a communication protocol and free and open-source software that implements encrypted VPNs. It aims for better performance, faster and simpler than the IPsec and OpenVPN tunneling protocols.

This add-on allows you to configure a WireGuard client that allows connections to remote WireGuard servers.

- **keep_alive** - A seconds interval, between 1 and 65535 inclusive, of how often to send an authenticated empty packet for keeping a stateful firewall or NAT mapping valid persistently.
